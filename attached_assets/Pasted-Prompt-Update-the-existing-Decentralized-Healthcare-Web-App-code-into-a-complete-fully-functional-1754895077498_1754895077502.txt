Prompt:

Update the existing Decentralized Healthcare Web App code into a complete, fully functional DID-based authentication system with both backend and frontend, ensuring secure user login, registration, and credential management.

Key Requirements:

Authentication & DID Integration:

Implement a secure login and registration system.

Use Decentralized Identity (DID) for authentication and access control.

Pre-create one default user for testing:

Username: healthuser

Password: Health@123

Allow new users to register via the login page.

Temporary Database:

Implement a simple in-memory or JSON-based temporary database for quick testing (can be replaced with a real DB later).

Store users, DIDs, and credentials in this database.

Include example data such as:

Fake DID: did:example:123456789abcdefghi

Fake credentials:

Health Checkup Report – Status: "Fit", Date: "2025-08-10"

Doctor Appointment – Dr. Jane Smith, Date: "2025-08-15", Time: "11:00 AM"

Features:

Patient Dashboard: Show DID info, fake credentials, upcoming appointments.

Doctor Dashboard: Verify patient’s DID and view issued credentials.

Credential Management: Issue and verify credentials (mock functionality).

History Page: Show all issued and received credentials.

UI/UX Update:

Fully responsive design (desktop + mobile).

Apply modern style: glassmorphism / material design / neumorphism.

Calming healthcare theme (blue, white, light green).

Add micro-interactions for actions like login, verification, credential issuance.

Clear typography, intuitive icons, rounded corners, modern font.

Components: Navbar, sidebar (if needed), cards, tables for credentials, forms with validation, action buttons.

Backend:

Node.js + Express backend handling authentication, DID generation, credential storage/retrieval.

API endpoints:

/register – Create new user + DID.

/login – Authenticate existing user.

/credentials – Fetch, add, or verify credentials.

Integration:

Connect frontend (React + TailwindCSS) with backend via REST API.

Ensure smooth authentication flow with JWT or session-based security.

Final Output:

A single runnable project folder with backend + frontend code.

Default login with provided credentials and ability to register new users.

All pages functional with example DID and credentials loaded from the temporary database.

Goal: A polished, production-style decentralized healthcare app prototype with working DID-based authentication, example credentials, and a modern, user-friendly interface.
