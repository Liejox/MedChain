Design a futuristic, clean, and secure UI/UX for a Decentralized Healthcare Web Application leveraging Decentralized Identity (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The app should streamline real-time patient-doctor interaction, secure medical document management, and role-specific dashboards for patients, doctors, and hospital administrators. Focus on trust, privacy, real-time access, and user-friendly design.

🧠 Core Features:
🔐 Secure Login & Onboarding using DID (wallet-based or QR scan)

🏥 Role-Based Dashboards:

👤 Patient: View health records, DID profile, appointment schedule, request VCs

🧑‍⚕️ Doctor: View assigned patients, verify DID & VCs, upload diagnosis

🏢 Hospital Admin: Manage doctors, approve access, generate global reports

📁 Real-Time Medical Document Sharing:

Upload & share prescriptions, lab reports, discharge summaries (PDF, images)

Grant access via VC-based permissions

📝 VC Issue/Verification:

Doctors issue verified medical credentials (e.g., COVID Vaccination, Surgery record)

Patients can request or present credentials to other providers

🔍 Document & Credential History Logs:

Timestamped and filterable

📅 Appointment Scheduling:

Book/reschedule with DID-backed doctor identity

📌 Notifications System:

Real-time updates for approvals, medical record updates, or document requests

🎨 Design Style:
Minimalist, professional layout using glassmorphism, material design, or neumorphism

Calming, healthcare-themed color palette: Blues, Light Greens, Soft Whites

Rounded corners, soft shadows, clear iconography, and modern font (e.g., Inter, Poppins)

Dark Mode Optional
